# dyloslogger
A perl logger to log data from a Dylos DC-1100-PRO Air Quality Monitor

I am using this to log data from a DC1100 Pro to a RaspberryPI and store the collected data into a logfile which i then use to create some RRD Graphs
to keep track of the pollution in my house while testing various methods to get cleaner air.
